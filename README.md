Technologies Used

Bash (Shell Scripting): Automates interactions with PostgreSQL.

PostgreSQL: Stores customer, service, and appointment data.

Git: Version control for managing project changes.

Database Schema

The database consists of three tables:

customers

customer_id (Primary Key, Auto-increment)

name (VARCHAR)

phone (VARCHAR, Unique)

services

service_id (Primary Key, Auto-increment)

name (VARCHAR)

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>

Set Up the Database
Open the PostgreSQL interactive shell:

psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres

Then create the database:

CREATE DATABASE salon;
\c salon;

Run the Script
Make sure the script has execute permissions:

chmod +x salon.sh

Then execute it:

./salon.sh

Usage

The script will display a numbered list of available services.

The user selects a service by entering the corresponding number.

The script prompts for a phone number.

If the phone number is new, it will prompt for a name and save the details.

If the phone number exists, it retrieves the existing customerâ€™s name.

The user enters a preferred appointment time.

The script confirms the booking.
